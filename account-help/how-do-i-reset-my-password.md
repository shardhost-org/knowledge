# How do I reset my account password?

To reset your account password, two options are offered to you:

Solution 1: Go to the login page and scroll to the bottom of the page until you reach the "Forgot password?" button and click on it. This will redirect you to the password reset page. Then enter your email address and solve the captcha to submit a password reset request. Wait for five minutes, and you will get an email with further instructions to reset the password. Finally, click on the link in the email to reset the password.

Solution 2: If you have your password, please log in to your account and click on your name, usually shown as "Hello, name!" at the top right-hand corner. Go ahead and choose "Change Password" from the drop-down menu and go ahead and input your new password.

If the below steps fail, please send an email to support@shardhost.com with most of your customer information and proof of your identity. We will then manually contact you to help reset your password.
